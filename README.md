# ionbar

This is ionbar. It is meant to provide an easy way to launch commands using
the ion shell. I use it with [XMonad](http://xmonad.org/).

## Screenshots

## Installation

Currently, I build it with [shake](http://shakebuild.com/). The downside of this
is that you'll have to have
[stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) installed.

## Usage
